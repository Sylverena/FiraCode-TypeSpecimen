            <h3>Comfort to code, code to software</h3>
            <p>
                Fira Code is derivation of Fira Sans, designed by Erik Spiekermann. Fira Sans was originally
                commissioned by Mozilla Corporation for the now defunct FireFox OS.
            </p>
            <p>Fira Sans was originally released in 2013 under the Apache license, then re-released in 2014 under the
                SIL Open Font License.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Fira was released under an open source license, users are free to modify it as long as it remains
                under the same license. Deriving from the monospaced typeface bundled with Fira Sans, Fira Code was
                conceived by user tonsky on GitHub.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fira Code contains a set of ligatures for common programming character combinations, such as >=, which is
                derived from <span style="font-variant-ligatures: none">>=</span>.

            <h3>From coding comfort, to ambigous software</h3>
            <p>Fira Code is geared largely towards programmers, as it is monospaced and contains ligatures for common
                symbols.</p>
            <p>The need for monospace fonts for code arises due to formatting and style conventions, often requiring
                stict alignment which simply isnâ€™t possible with non-monospaced fonts.</p>
            <p>For ligatures, many programming languages contains many symbols for their operations, and when visually
                parsing code, visual exhaustion can occur from the amount of different characters and symbols.</p>
            <p>For languages such as Haskell, they are primarily composed of symbols, ligatures can be a godsend.</p>
